    <p> About Me
        <br>
        <br> Born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and immigrated to the United States at age 3. I spent several years living in between countries which helped me develop both English and Spanish.
        <br>
        <br> I attended P-TECH the decorated 6 year early college high school in Brooklyn once visited by former president Barack Obama himself. The school gave students like me from underrepresented backgrounds a chance to attain a college degree. There is where I found my love for technology and was able to develop and receive my Associates of Applied Sciences in Computer Information Systems at the sole age of 18.
        <br>
        <br> Currently I am attending SUNY, University at Albany where I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business. In my short tenure here since transferring in Fall 2016 I've been able to make deans list join multiple organizations and currently work for Library Systems as a Student Assistant.
        <br>
        <br> I'm extremely interested in entrepreneurship and have dwindled with multiple ideas and look forward to making an impact to our society.
        <br>
        <br> The name is Duran, Joel Duran.</p>
    <h3>my work.</h3>
    <h3>Marketing and Communications Internship IBM</h3>
    <p>The instagram video above was in part coproduced by myself as I helped setup the filming location and also did the separate audio of the typewriter. This was my first internship with IBM in the summer of 2014. My internship included amazing projects like this that I got to see put up on IBM's social media handles but also included an individual project.
